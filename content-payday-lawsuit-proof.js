  whatWeDo: {
    intro: "At Credo Legal, we don't accept payday loan lawsuits at face value. Before we file a response, we investigate the loan's legality, the lender's licensing, and whether the collector can actually prove the debt is owed.",
    bullets: [
      "Demand proof of debt ownership and complete documentation.",
      "Challenge whether the loan was licensed and legally made in your state.",
      "Contest inflated balances from fees, rollovers, and improper charges.",
      "File your legal response incorporating every valid defense before the deadline.",
    ],
  },

  whyChoose: [
    ["Licensed attorneys — we examine before we respond", "We investigate the claim's foundation before filing a single word in court."],
    ["Payday loans have unique vulnerabilities", "Unlicensed lenders, rate violations, rollover inflation, and missing documentation create defenses that don't exist in other consumer-debt cases."],
    ["We demand proof", "The collector must prove they own the debt, that it's accurate, and that the original loan was legal in your state."],
    ["Dismissed debts come off your credit report", "A successfully challenged and dismissed payday loan debt may be removed from your credit report entirely."],
    ["Flexible payment plans", "Attorney-led defense structured around your budget."],
  ],

  commonProblems: [
    ["Debt sold without complete records", "Payday lenders sell portfolios frequently — often without full loan documentation. The paper trail required to prove a debt may simply not exist.", "FRE 803(6), 901"],
    ["No proof of ownership", "The entity suing you may be three or four steps removed from the original lender, with no clean chain of title.", "Chain of assignment"],
    ["Inflated balances", "Fees, rollovers, and interest charges can multiply the original loan amount many times over. Not all of those charges are legally enforceable.", "State payday law"],
    ["Unlicensed lenders", "Online payday lenders are required to hold a license in your state. Many don't. A loan from an unlicensed lender may be void.", "State payday law"],
    ["Above-cap interest rates", "Many states cap payday loan rates. A loan made above the cap may be partially or fully unenforceable.", "State usury law"],
    ["Loans you don't recognize", "If a loan was sold multiple times, the name on the lawsuit may bear no resemblance to who you originally borrowed from.", "FDCPA § 1692g"],
  ],

  howItWorks: [
    ["Free consultation", "Tell us about the lawsuit. We review the complaint and the debt with you at no cost.", "DAY 0"],

    ["Legal response filed", "We file your answer before the deadline, incorporating every challenge we've identified.", "BY DEADLINE"],
    ["Resolution", "We fight to dismiss, reduce, or settle the claim based on what the investigation reveals — and pursue removal from your credit report where dismissed.", "ONGOING"],

  whoHelps: [
    "Anyone sued by a debt buyer or collector over a payday loan they may not fully recognize.",
    "People whose payday loan balance has grown far beyond the original amount through fees and rollovers.",
    "Those who borrowed from an online lender and aren't sure whether it was licensed in their state.",
    "Anyone who wants the loan and the claim independently reviewed before paying, settling, or responding.",
    "People looking for an attorney who will actively challenge the debt, not just negotiate a payment plan.",

  faq: [
    ["How do I know if the collector actually has documentation for my payday loan?", "You often don't — and many collectors count on that. We demand documentation as part of our defense, and many cannot produce it."],
    ["Can a payday loan be challenged if I actually borrowed the money?", "Yes. The original loan amount may be legally disputed if the lender wasn't licensed, if the rate was above your state cap, or if fees were applied improperly."],
    ["What happens if the collector can't prove their case?", "The lawsuit can be dismissed. A dismissed payday loan debt can then be disputed with credit bureaus and potentially removed from your credit report."],
    ["Do I still need to respond even if I think the debt is wrong?", "Yes — and urgently. Failing to respond results in a default judgment regardless of whether the claim has merit. Responding is what preserves your right to challenge."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your consultation is free. We offer flexible payment plans and will explain every option before any commitment."],
