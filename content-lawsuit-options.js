/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Served_Papers — "Reassurance / Explore options" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/debt-lawsuit-options
   (2026-06-23). Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-summons-respond in the
   Served_Papers ad group: same phone (347) 523-4662, different framing.
   This LP is calming/explanatory ("One Free Conversation"); the sibling
   is urgent ("Act Today").

   Per-LP deviation resolved:
   - Common Problems had 5 bullets (std 6) → synthesized 6th "Default
     judgment already entered" matching the angle (reassurance about
     post-judgment options).

   Universal fixes already present on live:
   - Hero subhead reads "Our Attorneys" (was "Real Attorneys" in capture)
   - Why Choose bullet 2 reads "Our Attorneys Guide You Through" (was
     "Real Attorneys" in capture)
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied: civil-procedure citation mix, time
   markers, structured Your Rights items. Trust strip uses the Lawsuit
   cluster's "Court / Defense, not settlement only" set. */

Many collection suits are filed with incomplete documentation, inflated fees, or on debts that have been sold so many times that proper records no longer exist. We review the claim before filing anything and raise every challenge the facts support."],
    ["What if I think the debt is not mine or the amount is wrong?", "That is exactly what we look at. Before we file a response, we examine the complaint for accuracy, verify the claimed amount, and check whether the collector can prove they have the legal right to sue. Errors and documentation gaps are more common than most people expect."],
