/* Credo Legal — Credit Card / Negotiation — "Challenge Validity" angle (Var B).
   Source: live re-fetch during 2026-06-23 audit (live page is the
   distinctive one with the MISSING 'Why Choose' SECTION — only 6 body
   sections instead of standard 7).

   FIRST CREDIT CARD-CLUSTER LP applied to the new design. Phone
   (646) 952-7404 routes to CC Negotiation.

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - MISSING 'Why Choose Credo Legal' section on live → synthesized 5
     bullets matching the cluster pattern + the challenge-validity angle.
   - Section order on live is unusual (Common Problems before Why Choose
     would have been; standard template restored here). */

  faq: [
    ["How common is it for a credit card debt to be invalid?", "More common than most people realize. Credit card debts are frequently sold to third-party collectors — sometimes several times over — and documentation gets lost along the way. Balances can also be inflated with fees and interest that aren't legally enforceable."],
    ["What does “challenging debt validity” actually mean?", "It means our attorneys legally demand that the creditor prove — with documentation — that you owe the debt, that the amount is accurate, and that they have the legal right to collect it. If they can't prove it, the debt can be dismissed."],
    ["Can invalid debts really be removed from my credit report?", "Yes. If a debt is invalid, unenforceable, or improperly documented, it can be removed from your credit report — which can meaningfully improve your score."],
    ["What if my debt has already been sold multiple times?", "That actually strengthens the challenge. Each sale should come with documentation; chains often break, and standing becomes harder for the collector to prove."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "We offer flexible payment plans so attorney help is accessible without paying everything upfront. Your first case evaluation is completely free."],
