/* Credo Legal — Garnishment / Pre-Judgment — "Prevention" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/wage-garnishment-prevention
   (2026-06-23). Not in the 2026-06-01 capture set (capture mapped
   LP_PreJudgment-Garn_VarA to the legacy /stop-wage-garnishment URL).

   Same phone (720) 414-1751 as the Post-Judgment URLs — single team
   handles all Garnishment intent routing.

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - SUBHEAD-ANGLE MISMATCH on live: H1 'Garnishment Looming?' frames
     prevention but subhead reads 'Our Attorneys Can Help Find Grounds
     for Exemptions.' Exemptions is the Post-Judgment Var B angle, not
     prevention — looks copy-pasted from the sibling. REWRITTEN here to
     match the Prevention framing: 'Our Attorneys Can Help You Stop It
     Before It Starts.'
   - Spacing bug in HIW step 4: 'settlethe underlying debt' → fixed.
   - Bottom CTA double-space typo on live: 'Happen.   Get Help Today'
     → 'Happen. Get help today.' (also added body matching the angle).
   - Why Choose label-only on live → 5 label+body rows synthesized.
   - Common Problems label-only on live → 5 label+body rows + § cites.
     Count 5→6 (added 'Pre-judgment notice never received' due process).
   - FAQ 4 → 5 (added 'Does prevention work after they've already filed
     the lawsuit?' addressing the pre-vs-post-judgment timing question).
   - Your Rights 5 items already match standard pattern when promoted.

   Universal: state exclusion list includes NC. Hero already shows
   'Our Attorneys' in subhead (no voice fix needed there, but the
   subhead was angle-wrong — see above). */

    ["How long do I have to stop a garnishment before it starts?", "The window depends on where you are in the legal process. If you've received a summons, you typically have 20 to 28 days to respond before a default judgment can be entered. If a judgment has already been issued, your options shift — but don't disappear. The sooner you act, the more we can do."],
    ["Can you actually prevent garnishment before it hits my paycheck?", "Yes — if you act before a court order is entered. We file legal responses, challenge the underlying debt, and pursue every available remedy to block the garnishment order. Thousands of people have stopped garnishment before the first deduction with our help."],
    ["What if I can't afford an attorney right now?", "We offer flexible payment plans so you can get legal help without paying everything upfront. Protecting 100% of your paycheck now costs far less than losing 25% of it every month while you wait."],

    ["Does prevention work after they've already filed the lawsuit?", "Yes — that's actually the prime window. As long as no judgment has been entered yet, defending the lawsuit is the most direct path to preventing the garnishment that would follow. The response deadline is the critical date."],
