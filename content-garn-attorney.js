/* Credo Legal — Garnishment / Post-Judgment — "Fight Active Garnishment" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_PostJudgment-Garn_VarA_FightActive.md (2026-06-01).

   This is the FIRST GARNISHMENT-CLUSTER LP applied to the new design.
   Cluster-level shifts from Lawsuit:
   - Trust strip 'Court / Defense, not settlement only' → '25% / Federal
     garnishment cap' (15 U.S.C. § 1673) — concrete, vertical-specific.
   - situationOptions retuned for garnishment intent (threatened →
     ongoing → multiple → federal benefits → bank levy).
   - Citations lean on 15 U.S.C. § 1673, 31 C.F.R. § 212 (federal
     benefit protection), and state exemption rules.

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - Spacing bugs in HIW step 4 on live ('settle theunderlying debt',
     'another round ofenforcement') → fixed.
   - Voice violation in hero subhead → 'Real Attorneys' → 'Our
     Attorneys'.
   - Why Choose label-only bullets on live → expanded to label+body
     matching the cluster template.
   - Common Problems label-only bullets → expanded to label+body +
     citations. Count 5→6 (added 'Federal benefits being garnished'
     31 C.F.R. § 212).
   - Your Rights 5 → 6 (added 'Federal benefit protection' as 6th
     item, matching the synthesized Common Problem).
   - Bottom CTA was heading-only on live → added body matching the
     angle's reassurance + action framing.
   - State exclusion list includes NC. */
