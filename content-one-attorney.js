/* Credo Legal — Harassment / Multiple Collectors — "Overwhelm relief / One attorney" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/multiple-collectors-one-attorney
   (2026-06-23), supersedes the 2026-06-01 capture which had bracketed placeholders.

   Sibling of /multiple-collectors-more-money in the Multiple_Collectors ad group:
   same H1, same phone (347) 474-9602, different lede + body emphasis.
   This LP frames the situation as overwhelm and offers consolidation; the
   sibling frames it as opportunity and offers aggregated damages.

   Per-LP deviations resolved (same defaults as URL #5):
   - H1 typo on live: "Harasssing" (3 s's) → "Harassing".
   - Browser tab typo: "Ypu" → "You" (irrelevant here; we set a new
     SEO-tuned title in the HTML head).
   - Common Problems had 5 bullets (std 6) → added 6th "Calls about
     debts you've already paid or settled" (§ 1692e(2)) matching the
     cluster pattern and the "Collectors You Don't Recognize" theme.
   - Why Choose bullet 4 label: "Real Lawyers, Not a Settlement Company"
     → "Our Lawyers, Not a Settlement Company" (voice rule).

   Universal fixes:
   - Live page WWD bullet 4 already shows "Our attorneys" (capture's
     flagged "Real attorneys" was fixed upstream).
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied:
   - Common Problems gains FDCPA § citations
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */
