/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Collection_Lawsuit — "Proof Challenge" angle.
   Source: live capture LP_Lawsuit-Collection_VarB_ProofChallenge.md
   (2026-06-01, light bracketed completions filled from context).

   Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-respond-on-time (Collection_Lawsuit Var A
   Urgency) — same H1, same phone (212) 561-5902, different framing.
   This LP leans proof-challenge ("demand the records"); the sibling
   leans deadline-urgency ("respond on time").

   No structural deviations from the standard 14-block template.

   Universal fix:
   - Hero subhead: "Real Attorneys" → "Our Attorneys".
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied:
   - Common Problems gains FRE / FCRA / state-SOL citations
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = Lawsuit-cluster "Court / Defense, not settlement only". */

      "Examine the collector's documentation and proof of ownership.",
      "Challenge debt validity where records are incomplete or distorted.",

    ["What is a “zombie debt” and do I have to pay it?", "A zombie debt is an old debt, often past the legal time limit for collection, that resurfaces when bought by a new collector. Suing on a time-barred debt may itself be illegal."],
    ["Do I still need to respond to the lawsuit even if I think the debt is wrong?", "Yes — and urgently. Failing to respond results in a default judgment regardless of whether the debt is valid. The response is what preserves your right to challenge."],
