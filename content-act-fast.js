/* Credo Legal — All-States FDCPA / "Act Fast" angle (the cross-vertical
   FDCPA overlay LP, exclusive to the All-States tab — not used by any
   cluster-specific ad group).

   Per-LP deviations resolved:
   - Live H1 is a long single-line sentence with no subhead ("Let's See
     If We Can Help You with Creditor Harassment and Debt"). Rewritten
     here as a standard H1 + subhead matching the angle's 'act today'
     framing — the live hero pattern doesn't fit the new design's
     two-part structure.
   - Live filler reads 'Fill in the short form below to see if you
     qualify' (qualification-gated framing). Rewritten to standard
     'Fill in the form...' for consistency.
   - Live Bottom CTA is missing the 'Call' link — only the button.
     Restored here. Phone: (718) 865-8350 (same as the legacy
     /fcba-and-fdcpa LP).
   - Standard 14-block template otherwise; live body sections are all
     present with rich copy.

   No voice violations on live (this LP was rewritten with 'Our
   Attorneys' throughout). */

  whatWeDo: {
    intro: "At Credo Legal, an FDCPA violation is not just something to complain about — it's a legal claim we start building immediately. We send a cease letter the day you enroll, track every subsequent contact as potential evidence, and move your case from violation to legal action without delay.",
    bullets: [
      "Cease-communication letter sent on day one — contact must stop.",
      "Every violation after the cease request documented and catalogued.",
      "FDCPA claims pursued for up to $1,000 per lawsuit, plus attorney fees.",

  whyChoose: [
    ["Licensed attorneys — we act the day you enroll", "No waiting for paperwork, no intake delays. The cease letter goes out the same day."],
    ["We track every violation", "Each illegal call, threat, or contact after a cease request is documented. Each one adds to your claim."],
    ["Speed is our USP", "FDCPA cases are built on documented violations. The sooner we start tracking, the stronger the case."],
    ["From violation to lawsuit", "We don't just stop the calls. We pursue every legal claim the violations support."],

    ["Does sending a cease letter affect the underlying debt?", "No. A cease letter stops contact — it doesn't resolve or erase the debt. We handle the harassment and evaluate the debt separately, advising you on the best path for both."],
    ["What if the collector stops calling once they get the cease letter?", "That's the goal. If they stop, you have relief. If they don't, every subsequent call is a documented $1,000 violation that we pursue. Either way, you're in a better position."],
    ["What if violations already happened before I called you?", "We document what's already occurred as well. Violations from the past year are potentially recoverable. The sooner you call, the more we can document going forward too."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your first consultation is free. FDCPA attorney fees are recoverable from the collector when you prevail — meaning pursuing your claim may cost you nothing out of pocket on the harassment side."],
