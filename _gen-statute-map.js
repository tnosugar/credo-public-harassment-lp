      <p><strong>What this is.</strong> Every "What we see" bullet and every FAQ on every LP, paired with the FDCPA section it is inferred from. Built to answer the compliance question "do we need to put the statute number anywhere?" by making the underlying statute auditable in one place.</p>
      <p><strong>How to read it.</strong> Click any statute box to expand the full U.S. Code excerpt. Click <em>view on LP</em> next to any item to jump to that item on the live landing page (opens in a new tab). FAQ statute citations are inferred by content keyword; commonProblems statutes come from the content file directly.</p>
      <p><strong>Source.</strong> 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq. — Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Excerpts faithful to the U.S. Code; long enumeration lists trimmed for scannability.</p>
