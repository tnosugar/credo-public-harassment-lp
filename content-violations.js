/* Credo Legal — Harassment / Violations ($1K-per-violation / financial-motivation angle).
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/debt-harassment-violations
   (2026-06-23), supersedes the 2026-06-01 capture which had bracketed placeholders.

   No per-LP structural deviations. Sibling of /debt-harassment-stop-calls in
   the Creditor_Harassment ad group: same H1, same phone (201) 416-7080,
   different lede + body emphasis ("Make Them Pay" vs "Make Them Stop").

   Universal fixes applied:
   - Subhead is already "Our Attorneys Can Make Them Pay." on live (the
     2026-06-01 capture flagged "Real Attorneys" but the live page has
     since been corrected). No further voice fix needed.
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Live-copy bugs fixed silently while applying:
   - "$1,000per lawsuit" → "$1,000 per lawsuit" (missing space)
   - "everypost-letter call" → "every post-letter call" (missing space)

   Design enhancements applied per 2026-06-23 decisions:
   - Common Problems gains FDCPA § citations per bullet
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */
