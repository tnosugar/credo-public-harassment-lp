/* Credo Legal — Harassment / Multiple Collectors — Aggregation / "More Money" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/multiple-collectors-more-money
   (2026-06-23), supersedes the 2026-06-01 capture which had bracketed placeholders.

   Per-LP deviations handled per 2026-06-23 socratic decisions:
   - H1 typos on live: "Multipe Debt Collectors Harrasing You?" → fixed to
     "Multiple Debt Collectors Harassing You?". Brand-quality copy on the
     new design; the broken live H1 remains on production until they
     push their own fix.
   - Section heading typo on live: "Common Problems we See" → "Common
     Problems We See". (Handled by renderer's standard heading.)
   - Why Choose had 4 bullets (std 5) → added "Free consultation" row
     matching the sibling Harassment LPs' pattern.
   - Common Problems had 5 bullets (std 6) → added "Misrepresenting the
     amount owed" entry (§ 1692e(2)) to match the standard cluster set.
   - FAQ had 4 items (std 5) → added "How much does this cost?" entry
     matching every other Harassment LP's last FAQ.

   Universal fixes:
   - Live page already shows voice-corrected "Our Attorneys" in hero +
     Why Choose label (capture's flagged "Real Attorneys" instances were
     fixed upstream).
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied:
   - Common Problems gains FDCPA § citations
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = prototype's compliance-safe credentials. */

We track every breach from every source — every early-morning call, every workplace contact, every threat, every contact after a cease request.
