  faq: [
    ["What happens if I don't respond to a payday loan lawsuit?", "The court enters a default judgment automatically. This gives the lender or collector the right to garnish wages and levy bank accounts — without ever having to prove the loan was valid."],
    ["How long do I have to respond?", "Typically 20 to 28 days from the date you were served, depending on your state. The clock starts the day of service."],
    ["Can a payday loan be challenged if I actually borrowed the money?", "Yes — in many cases. The original loan amount may be legally disputed if the lender was unlicensed, if the rate was above the state cap, or if disclosures were inadequate."],
    ["What if I borrowed from an online lender I found through an ad?", "Online payday lenders are required to be licensed in the state where the borrower lives. Many are not. Lack of licensing where you live can void the loan."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your consultation is free. We offer flexible payment plans and will explain every option before any commitment."],
