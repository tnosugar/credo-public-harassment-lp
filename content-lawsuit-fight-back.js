/* Credo Legal — Lawsuit / Defense — "Fight Back" angle.
   Source: live re-fetch of https://start.credolegal.com/debt-lawsuit-fight-back
   (2026-06-23). Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-attorney in the Lawsuit-Defense
   ad group: same H1, same phone (347) 523-4568, different lede + tone.
   This LP runs combative ("they bet on default") framing; the sibling
   runs access-to-counsel ("level the field") framing.

   Per-LP deviation resolved (same defaults as URLs #5, #6):
   - Why Choose had 4 bullets (std 5) → added 5th "Free consultation"
     row matching the sibling LP and cluster pattern.

   Universal fixes already present on live:
   - Hero subhead reads "Our Attorneys Can Help You Challenge Their
     Claims." (capture's flagged "Real Attorneys" was fixed upstream).
   - Why Choose bullet 3 reads "Our Attorneys From Day One" (capture
     flagged "Real Attorneys" — fixed upstream).
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Design enhancements applied:
   - Common Problems gains civil-procedure / FDCPA citation mix
   - How It Works gains time markers (DAY 0 → ONGOING; deadline-aware)
   - Your Rights bullets promoted to structured items
   - Trust strip = "Court / Defense, not settlement only" (Lawsuit
     cluster), not the FDCPA Harassment-cluster set. */
