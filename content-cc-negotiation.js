  faq: [
    ["How is attorney-led negotiation different from doing it myself?", "Card companies negotiate differently when there's an attorney involved. A lawyer can challenge the validity of the debt, dispute inflated amounts, and apply legal pressure that a consumer calling on their own simply can't. That difference typically means better terms and a lower settlement."],
    ["Will settling for less hurt my credit?", "Settlements can affect your credit score — but so does ongoing unpaid debt. In many cases, resolving debt is better for your long-term credit health than letting balances continue to grow. We'll walk you through all the tradeoffs in your free consultation."],
    ["What if my debt is already in collections?", "We work with debt at all stages, including debt that's already been sold to collectors. In some cases, collectors cannot even prove you owe the debt — which creates additional leverage in negotiations."],
    ["What if the creditor sues me before we settle?", "We're prepared to defend you if it gets to that point. Many settlements happen specifically because the creditor knows we're ready to litigate if needed."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "We offer flexible payment plans so attorney-led help is accessible without paying everything upfront. Your first case evaluation is completely free."],
