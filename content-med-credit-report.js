  faq: [
    ["Can medical debt actually be removed from my credit report?", "Yes — in many cases. Recent CFPB rule changes have restricted the reporting of medical debt significantly. Paid amounts under certain thresholds and recent debts may already be excluded."],
    ["What if the debt is legitimate? Can it still come off my report?", "Possibly. Paid or settled debts should be updated. Even valid debts may be removable if they were reported in error or violate recent CFPB rules."],
    ["How long does medical debt stay on a credit report?", "Up to seven years from the date of first delinquency — but that's the maximum, not a guarantee. Legal disputes can shorten that timeline substantially."],
    ["Will disputing the debt cause any problems?", "No. You have a legal right to dispute inaccurate information. Collectors cannot retaliate against you for exercising this right."],
    ["How much does this cost?", "Your consultation is free. We offer flexible payment plans, and we'll walk you through every option before any commitment."],
