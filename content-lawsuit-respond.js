   580+ conversions, 11% conv rate, $51 CPA per CAMPAIGN-PLAN.md.

   Sibling of /debt-lawsuit-proof (Var B Proof Challenge) in the
   Collection_Lawsuit ad group: same H1, same phone (212) 561-5902,
   different lede. This LP runs deadline-urgency framing.

   Per-LP deviations resolved (same defaults as URLs #5, #6, #9, #10):
   - Common Problems had 5 bullets (std 6) → added 6th 'Wage garnishment
     after default' (15 U.S.C. § 1673) matching the urgency angle.
   - Your Rights had 5 items (std 6) → added 6th 'Validation right'
     (FDCPA § 1692g) — matches cluster pattern.
   - Tab title 'Judgement' (UK) → 'Judgment' (US) per May action
     items §1 (broken on live, fixed here via new SEO-tuned title).

   Universal voice fixes (3 instances on this LP):
   - Hero subhead: 'Real Attorneys Can Help You Respond On Time' →
     'Our Attorneys Can Help You Respond On Time'.
   - Why Choose b1 body: 'Real lawyers defend you from day one' →
     'Our attorneys defend you from day one'.
   - Why Choose b5 body: 'Real legal defense, structured around your
     budget' → 'Legal defense, structured around your budget'.
   - State exclusion list includes NC.

   Footer phone bug noted in the audit — fixed automatically by the
   prototype's renderer (footer 'Existing Clients' line hardcoded to
   (212) 461-4026, separate from the per-LP routing number).

   Design enhancements applied (full set per 2026-06-23 decisions). */
