  whatWeDo: {
    intro: "When you're sued for medical debt, we don't wait. We review the lawsuit, identify errors or invalid charges in the bill, file your legal answer before the deadline, and build a defense. A timely response is the single most important thing that can happen right now — and it's what we do first.",
    bullets: [
      "Review the summons and confirm your response deadline (typically 20–28 days from service).",
      "Examine the underlying medical bill for errors, inflated charges, and documentation gaps the hospital or collector can't close.",
      "File your legal answer before the deadline — the single step that blocks a default judgment.",
      "Build the defense to challenge the bill's validity, the collector's standing to sue, and any misrepresentation in the filing itself under FDCPA § 1692e.",
