   Source: live capture LP_PaydayLoan-Rights_VarA_Education.md (2026-06-01).

   Phone (347) 744-9014 — Payday Rights + Lawsuit shared routing,
   distinct from Payday Harassment's (407) 512-0808. Internal logic:
   Lawsuit + Rights → defense-track team; Harassment → FDCPA-claims team.

   No structural deviations. Universal voice + grammar fix:
   Hero subhead 'Real Attorney Can Help You Understand Them and Act'
   (singular, missing article) → 'Our Attorneys Can Help You Understand
   Them and Act.'

   No other deviations. Clean LP. */

  whatWeDo: {

Under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, you have the right to revoke ACH authorization — the electronic permission you gave the lender to debit your account. Notify your bank in writing; withdrawals must stop within 3 business days."],
