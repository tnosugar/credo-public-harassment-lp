/* Credo Legal — Harassment LP set · review widget config.
 *
 * Comments persist to the same Firebase Realtime Database used by the Meta Ads
 * preview surface (project credo-712c4). The page-slug rule in review-mode.js
 * derives per-LP buckets from URL pathname, so harassment-LP comments don't
 * collide with the ad-preview's comments — they live under their own
 * `/comments/{pushId}` records with a per-LP `page` field.
 *
 * Each LP variant HTML in this folder loads review-bootstrap.js, so the entry
 * button shows up on every variant + on the review hub itself. Reviewers click
 * the button → ?review=1 → widget loads on that LP. The hub propagates ?review=1
 * into its iframes so opening any LP through the hub enters review mode for the
 * LP as well.
 *
 * Until FIREBASE_CONFIG is filled in, comments are stored in THIS browser only
 * (localStorage) — fine for solo review, but NOT shared.
